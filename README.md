# Domino
 

Domino is a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) that allows you to study and learn online, access learning resources,
and interact with other users.
A recent study suggests that some VLE's are over complex and only a minor percentage use the majority of its features. My 
university project was to build, from the ground up, a lightweight/lean VLE that is more accessible to
mobile or on-the-move type devices.
The software system is a working VLE, with learning content being uploaded by tutors and delivered to learners
through its web user interface and users being able to communicate with eachother through individual forums for each 
course uploaded.
It is built in HTML/PHP with the users and content being stored in my university's SQL database.
